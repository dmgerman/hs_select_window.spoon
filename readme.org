* Purpose:

- jump to any window by selecting part of its name or its application
- windows are listed in the order they have been active (from most recent)
- each window is listed by window title and application name
- supports incremental search

* Example

[[./screenshot.png]]  
  
type ema

and you get

[[./screenshot-3.png]]

type return and you are sent to the top window


* How to  install

I assume you have installed hammerspoon and you have a ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua file

The easiest way is to clone this repository inside your .hammerspoon directory:

#+begin_src bash   :exports both
cd ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons
git clone https://github.com/dmgerman/hs_select_window.spoon.git
#+end_src

This should create a directory called 
~/.hammerspoon/Spoons/hs_select_window.spoon with an init.lua file inside

Then modify your ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua file and add the following:

#+begin_src lua   :exports both
hs.loadSpoon("hs_select_window")

-- customize bindings to your preference
local SWbindings = {
   all_windows =  { {"alt"}, "b"},
   app_windows =  { {"alt", "shift"}, "b"}
}   
spoon.hs_select_window:bindHotkeys(SWbindings)
#+end_src

* How to use

This spoon binds the keys:

- option-b:  display a list of all windows
- shift-option-b: display list of windows of the current application

Use either one to select and activate any window. 


Note that the current window does not appear in the list of windows.

* To be done

- add functionality to display only windows in the current workspace

* Known bugs

- None at this point
